# My Early Coding Projects

This repository contains my earlier coding projects created while learning programming fundamentals.  
It includes small experiments and practice files.

## Projects
- `snake-and-ladder-cpp/` â€” Console Snake & Ladder game (C++).
- `Ticket Reservation System.cpp/`- Ticket Reservation System (C++)

These projects are part of my learning history. I am currently focusing on MERN stack development.
